    <h1>The Learn Enough Story</h1>
    
    <p>Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach <em>technical sophistication</em>, the seemingly magical ability to take
      command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard
      shortcuts, Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing. We believe there are <strong>at least a billion people</strong> 
      who can benefit from learning technical sophistication, probably more. To join our movement, <a href = "https://learnenough.com/email" > sign up for our official email list now </a>. </p>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <h2>Founders</h2>

    <p>Learn Enough to Be Dangerous was founded in 2015 by Michael Hartl, Lee
    Donahoe, and Nick Merwin. We believe that the kind of technical sophistication taught by the Learn Enough tutorials can benefit
    at least a <strong><em>billion</em></em></strong> people, and probably more.</p>

    <strong>make them strong</strong> to stand out among less spectacular ones.
    
    <p>William Shakespeare's <em>Sonnets</em> consists of 154 poems, each fourteen lines 
    long (three <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quatrain" target="_blank">quatrains</a> followed by a rhyming <a href="https://en.wikipedi.org/wiki/Couplet">couplet</a>). 
    <strong>Sonnet 18</strong>  is perhaps the most famous, and begins like this:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?Thou art more lovely and more temperate.</p>
