      William Shakespeare's <em>Sonnets</em> consists of 154 poems, each fourteen lines 
      long (three <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quatrain" target="_blank">quatrains</a> followed by a rhyming <a href="https://en.wikipedi.org/wiki/Couplet">couplet</a>). 
      <strong>Sonnet 18</strong>  is perhaps the most famous, and begins like this:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
      Thou art more lovely and more temperate. 
    </p>  
  </blockquote>
