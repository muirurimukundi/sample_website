    <strong>make them strong</strong> to stand out among less spectacular ones.
    
    <p>William Shakespeare's <em>Sonnets</em> consists of 154 poems, each fourteen lines 
    long (three <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quatrain" target="_blank">quatrains</a> followed by a rhyming <a href="https://en.wikipedi.org/wiki/Couplet">couplet</a>). 
    <strong>Sonnet 18</strong>  is perhaps the most famous, and begins like this:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?Thou art more lovely and more temperate.</p> 

    </blockquote>
